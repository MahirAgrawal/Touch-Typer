# Touch_Typer: Touch Typing Practice Website

#### <u>What's the best way to improve typing speed?</u>
> #### <strong><u>Practice</u></strong>.Nothing can replace it. So here i present you a website for practicing touch typing.

#### <u>Motivation behind making:</u>
Majority of the apps and websites which are made for this having either of two problems:
1) Ads are everywhere on the page and large js files which makes site deadly slow
#### For comparison, my website load faster than 90% of the popular touch typing website(metrics checked on https://tools.pingdom.com/)
2) Also many of the professional version of these apps give practice for the words which don't exist, like you would never encounter 'aaaaa' in real life.

So i have tried to keep this one as <u>optimized and minimal</u> as possible. 

#### Features
By clicking on Settings you can do the following:
1) Range Slider for font-size
2) Dropdown for Font-Family 
3) Check-box for bold on/off 

#### After this click on save, your changes will be reflected in practice section and you will be redirected back to the home page.

Touch Typing is a crucial skill so have it. 
So wish you luck for more than 100 WPM soon!! ðŸ˜„
